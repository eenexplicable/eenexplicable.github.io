I committed a pretty serious wrong this past week. It was of a kind and degree that makes me question who I actually am. I don't want to be the kind of person who does such things. So I am taking a little bit of time to engage in some introspection and figure myself out. Writing is something that helps me sort out my thoughts, so I'm writing about it. And my suspicion is that I should be doing this regularly, so I'm starting a blog.

Well, I'm starting _another_ blog. I've tried to do blogs before. I never keep them up. We'll see how it goes this time, I guess.

## What I Did

So what did I do? I told a more senior leader in my labor union&mdash;let's call her Gloria&dash;I would refer members concerned about a particularly upsetting rumor to her&mdash;providing her personal contact info&mdash;if a specific measure to combat a rumor didn't end up happening. As some context, it really looks to me like her decision to share some hearsay at a worksite membership meeting had done much to fuel that rumor if not actually start it. There is additional context too, but the unmistakeable truth is that I was completely out of line no matter the context. I acted rashly and aggressively toward her. Whatever Gloria's wrongs may or may not have been, she didn't deserve that. And whether she deserved it or not, it's not something that could be done by the person I want to be, or even thought I was.

The immediate back-and-forth, including my statement, took place in one the union leader group texts for all to see. Gloria reacted by telling me I was "not being professional in working as a team," that she could not allow herself to be treated that way for her heath, and that she was resiging her leadership role. I apologized profusely, both privately and publically; asked her to give me a second chance; and offered to resign instead of her if she really didn't want work with me anymore. She hasn't responded to that yet, and I don't know how she will when she does. But I realize that actions like mine have consequences. Even if she forgives me, I alarmed her, hurt her feelings, and lost a substantial amount of respect of at least several people.

A factor in my behavior is the way I heard what Gloria had said when repeating her hearsay at the site meeting. The version I heard was very bad for us, would have been unlawful for the employer to have said under the circumstances at that time, and was obviously unlikely to be true for that and a couple other reasons. I bring this up because my reaction to thinking Gloria was repeating something so negative and so unlikely, without any advance notice to me, should have been to question whether I heard it right and ask her.

But that didn't even occur to me. I could cite in my defense that a few other people there heard it similarly. There is plenty of room to argue that the key phrase is usually used to mean what I thought she meant. But apparently most people who heard Gloria speak understood her claim to have made a much less extreme. I asked more people after something Gloria said revealed she had _meant_ something else, and that something else ended up being what the majority of people thought she meant. There was room to give her some credit for not trying to stir the pot. But that didn't even occur to me.

It was because I was emotionally charged. All of it was. Like I said, there is a lot of context for this incident. Gloria and I have had a pretty intense course of dealing over the past few weeks, spanning multiple issues and multiple modes of communication. It's clear I allowed my emotions to become primed against her. The details are beside the point (or at least, I keep telling myself that). No matter what happened before, I should have paused, checked on my emotions, and taken care of them before acting.

## Facing Myself

The process of writing up to this point has involved me repeatedly let slip out talk of Gloria's and even others' behavior that I perceived was also wrong, then deleting that talk because it's a distraction. My writing here has a purpose, and it's not that. _That_ is my ego trying to protect itself from judgment. I thought a very small amount of context was needed to be comprehensible, but I tried very hard to ensure it's not motivated by defensiveness. My mind wants _so badly_ to talk about every single way that I'm not the real bad guy here. Or at least not the worst bad guy. But even if all that is true, _I am a bad guy in this story._ However enlightened and unburdened by ego I like to think I am, grappling with this realization is hard. Writing this has been hard. But I must accept it if I am to learn from it and change my behavior.

I'm sure I deserve to feel a lot worse than I do in the present moment. I mean, I felt after it happened, pretty much for the rest of the day, especially when I realized I may have misinterpreted some facts. And I'm sure I'll feel even more terrible the next time I face Gloria or any other people who observed how I treated her. But right now my mind is in a problem-solving mode. I'm not engaging with my guilt; I'm analyzing what happened in an effort to fix what went wrong for the future. Maybe making this into an intellectual problem is another way my ego is protecting itself from judgment. Maybe I'm using this to evade the experience of feeling that I'm bad. But even so, I'm also trying to improve myself and protect others from having to experience this from me in the future.

A large part of the reason I am deciding to publish this online is to try to keep myself honest. I am doing it anonymously, but the idea exists in my mind that someone who knows me might discover it and call me out on my bullshit. And that idea helps. Even if I successfully remain anonymous, someone could call me out on my bullshit. A large amount of self-delusion in this world is obvious on the face of it. Whatever helps me not bullshit myself, I could use some.

## Going Further

It's really late, and I'm really exhausted right now. So I am going to get some sleep. But it's my intent to continue this once I'm better-rested.
